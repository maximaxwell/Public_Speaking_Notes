# Public_Speaking_Notes
Google Digital Garage course Public Speaking notes:

Who? How? When? What? Why?
Nerves are normal, Plan/Prepare in advance, Treat the presentation like a performance,
Do speech exercises beforehand
Formal/Funny, how long, don't sidetrack on unimportant details, why are you doing this
Certain qualities? to inform, teach or inspire your audience?, Write your plan down,
2 columns before and an after Before: everything you think your audience will know before
your presentation After: everything you want the audience to retain Bridge: the before 
and after using a middle column this will be your presentation.
Body language, body sends messages to the audience, position of your body, the spacing
of your legs, your arm movement, facial expressions, crossing your arms or tapping your
foot is a stress reaction but the audience may interpet it as boredom or not wanting
to be there and this looks unprofessional. don't shift body weight from one leg
to the other when standing up and speaking or cross your legs or do a dance from
a mixture of these this gives the audience the impression of you feeling uneasy
and you being clumsy. Be well centered with a strong stable standing position, place
your legs a little further than hip length apart remain loose and flexible, 
your legs are loose and your knees aren't tight, avoid slouching by keeping your
back and head up and drawn towards the ceiling, being centered does not mean staying 
still, you can still move and make gestures with your arms to compliment your
words, if you are going to walk make sure you have a destination e.g to point at 
something on your presentation if present, you can walk from one side of the stage to
the other, walk with purpose to highlight transition in your speech, when you change
topic walk back again, this changes perspective, allows you to catch your breath,
allows you to make a transition between 2 parts of your talk, marks a change, good 
gestures consist of the palm of your hand up and your arms should make full rounded
gestures not closed ones, keep your arms springy and not glued to your body, 
arms/hands shouldn't hide your face when you move, use the energy you have from your
nerves and the compassion from your speech to control the gestures, don't put
your arms behind your back, don't fold your arms and don't lean on a table, don't
fiddle with an object, all of these movements give the impression of boredom
or lack of confidence, don't stare at the same person for too long or it can
cause embarrasment for that person and the rest will feel that it doesn't apply to them 
and subconsciously lose interest. few seconds on one person then onto another until
you reach the furthest point of the audience, when you reach the audience swoop slowly
from the other direction (all of this is in a w shape), remember to smile, smile with
your mouth and also with your eyes to show professionalism and friendliness wanting them
to listen, if your eyes don't smile your smile will be forced, if your not happy to be 
there then the audience won't want to be there either. Verbal tics are bad for e.g
saying the same word over again for example like, actually, basically, so, and then,
ummmm, errr. in order to minimize your verbal tics you need to become aware of them
film yourself take a subject that you haven't prepared and talk to the camera. if 
the tics are words prepare synonyms in advance and if they are sounds replace them with
a short breath or pause. nerves=good because without them we have no energy, without
energy  we don't have audience concentration, tell yourself your heart is racing 
because you have something important to say, be on your own for a bit before the 
presentation and warm your vocal cords, just before you get onto the stage and start 
speaking mentally rehearse your first sentence once the first sentence is said you will
be able to carry on with your talk rehydrate before the presentation so you don't get
a dry mouth and if possible bring water into the presentation, stress can cause us to
have problems articulating to remedy this place your tongue between your upper and 
lower teeth close your teeth firmly over your tongue without hurting yourself say the
first sentences of your talk outloud while keeping your tongue between your teeth
release your tongue and now speak normally, speak loudly, clearly and articulate
the best you can, the rythm of your speech should be sustained but not too fast certain
words should be emphasised, silence can be used as your helper, with a memory relapse
just take a pause of silence the audience won't hold this against you and most won't
notice at all
